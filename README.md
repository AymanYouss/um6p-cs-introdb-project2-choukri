# OCP Casablanca City - Feed Phosphates Sales Data Management System

## Overview

The Feed Phosphates Sales Data Management System is a web-based solution designed to improve the workflow of the Business Unit at OCP in Casablanca City. This system is specifically developed to address the inefficiencies and challenges associated with managing sales data for feed phosphates. The current process relies on an error-prone Excel file, which has proven to be cumbersome, time-consuming, and prone to errors.


## Problem Statement

The current process for managing feed phosphates sales data at OCP's SPSS Strategic Business Unit (SBU) faces several challenges:

1. **Inefficiency**: The use of Excel spreadsheets makes it difficult to efficiently manage and track customer orders, product demand, pricing, shipment details, and other relevant information.

2. **Error-Prone**: Manual data entry and updates in Excel increase the likelihood of errors, which can lead to costly mistakes and confusion.

3. **Lack of Centralization**: Various departments, including sales, logistics, and sales operations, rely on the same Excel file without a centralized system, causing delays, miscommunication, and decreased productivity.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Streamline Data Management**: Provide an easy-access platform for users to store, retrieve, and manage feed phosphates sales data efficiently.

2. **User Permissions**: Implement role-based access control, ensuring that each user has limited permissions over the database, allowing them to interact with entries relevant to their department.

3. **Data Visualization**: Offer ready-to-use commands for data visualization to enhance decision-making processes.

4. **Dynamic Entry Forms**: Customize fillable entries based on the status of each transaction, ensuring that users only input the necessary information for a given scenario.
